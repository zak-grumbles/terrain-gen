# Control Panel

#### Camera Panel
* Yaw (side-to-side) - Adjusts the yaw of the camera. Value is given in degrees.
* Pitch (up-down) - Adjusts the pitch of the camera. Value given in degrees.
* Roll (do a barrel roll!) - Adjusts the roll of the camera. Value given in degrees.
* EyeX - Controls the X coordinate of the camera.
* EyeY - Controls the Y coordinate of the camera.
* EyeZ - Controls the Z coordinate of the camera.

#### Terrain Panel
* Wireframe - If checked, terrain will be rendered as a wireframe. This looks much better, trust me. When unchecked, it will render filled.
* Cell Size - Changes the size of each cell in the grid.
* "Sample from" values - Changes the ranges over which the noise function is sampled. This has the heaviest affect on the terrain produced.

#### Presets
* Try them and see!
