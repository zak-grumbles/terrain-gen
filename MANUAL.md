# Control Panel

#### Camera Controls
* W - move forward
* A - move left
* S - move backward
* D - move right
* Q - move down
* E - move up
* To rotate the camera, click and drag using the mouse.

#### Terrain Panel
* Wireframe - If checked, terrain will be rendered as a wireframe. This looks much better, trust me. When unchecked, it will render filled.
* Cell Size - Changes the size of each cell in the grid.
* "Sample from" values - Changes the ranges over which the noise function is sampled. This has the heaviest affect on the terrain produced.

#### Presets
* Try them and see!
