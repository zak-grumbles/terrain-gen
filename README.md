# terrain-gen
Procedural Terrain Generation using the Marching Cubes Algorithm, OpenGL, and C++

## About
This started as a project for my computer graphics class, but I wanted to continue working on it and expanding its functionality. At the time of writing, the program is just a barebones terrain generator. However, I have several ideas for improving the software in terms of both usability and performance. This code is being released under the GNU Public License, so feel free to take it, break it, or improve it however you like.

## Releases
* [v1.0](https://github.com/zak-grumbles/terrain-gen/releases/tag/v1.0) - Barebones Terrain Generation

## Usage
When executed, the program will generate its default terrain. After it finishes this rendering, the terrain can be altered by changing any of the terrain variables in the control panel. The camera is controlled via the control panel as well. I know, this sucks. I'll be putting in WASD movement as soon as I get the time.

## Libraries Used
* [libnoise](http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/) - Used to generate the noise function.

### Thanks!
